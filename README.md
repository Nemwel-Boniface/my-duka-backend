# My Duka Back end

My duka backend is an API for an application that aims to be an inventory management system. The application will also have an admins dashboard where only the admins and those given permission will be able to edit, delete or add inventory. By default, all users can be able to see the inventory that is available in the store.


The application will be built on the Ruby on Rails framework on the backend and React and Redux for its front end.


The link to the front end can be found [here](https://github.com/Nemwel-Boniface/my-duka-frontend)
